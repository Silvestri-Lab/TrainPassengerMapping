# Synthetic Dataset Generator for Italian Trains

This repository contains the code for generating a synthetic dataset of Italian train schedules. The code is designed to create realistic train schedule datasets, which can be used for academic research, machine learning models, and simulation purposes.

## Dataset

The synthetic dataset is based on the actual train schedules provided by [E656](https://www.e656.net), a comprehensive resource for Italian train schedules. This project utilizes these schedules to generate new, synthetic instances that adhere to realistic operational constraints and timings.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed in collaboration with the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/) and [Motion Analytica](http://www.motionanalytica.com), leveraging their extensive research and development resources in transportation analytics.
